# CYRIAL
A C++/Python interface built on PyVISA to provide a communication interface for Jackson Labs GPSDO's (SCPI), u-blox GNSS receivers (UBX), and Microsemi/Symmetricom CSAC's.

This repository was a band-aid to get Python-based prototype code working with a C++ interface. There are a lot of issues with this code and I recommend not using it in favor of [CRACL](https://github.com/coltonriedel/cracl), a second approach which uses Boost ASIO. I leave the repository up and public because the Python/C++ interfacing may be of interest
