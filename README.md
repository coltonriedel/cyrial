# CYRIAL
A C++ interface built on PyVISA to provide a communication interface for Jackson Labs GPSDO's (SCPI), u-blox GNSS receivers (UBX), and Microsemi/Symmetricom CSAC's.

Not that anyone external will ever find this, but it has a lot of quirks/bugs and you'll probably have issues with ports on your device
